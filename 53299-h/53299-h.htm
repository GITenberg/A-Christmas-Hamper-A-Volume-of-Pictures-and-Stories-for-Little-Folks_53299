<p class="drop-cap">He seemed a funny old gentleman,
the children thought, but still
rather nice, especially when he brought
those sweets out of his pocket and let
them dip into the bag and take what they
liked. They had seen him walking through
the wood, and then when they left off playing,
he had come to sit down beside them, and
asked them their names.</p>

<p>“Mine’s Hugh, like father,” said the eldest; “and this
is Lily, and this is Tom.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman looked a little quickly at Tom.</p>

<p>“Who is he named after?” he said.</p>

<p>The children’s faces grew grave.</p>

<p>“He is named after poor Uncle Tom,” said Lily in a
low voice, “who went to sea and was drowned.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute. Then the old gentleman
spoke again,—</p>

<p>“So poor Uncle Tom was drowned, was he?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hugh. “His ship was lost, and everybody
was drowned, ’cept two or three that got in the boat, and
Uncle Tom wasn’t among them. Father waited and waited,
but it wasn’t any good. So then he put up a monument
in the church just where we can see it from our pew.”</p>

<p>“And we always sings about the saints of God on
his burfday,” said Lily, “and father cries a little.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 541px;">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" width="541" height="700" alt="Tom carved in tree" />
</div>

<p>“No, he don’t!” said Hugh indignantly. “Father’s
a man, and men don’t cry!”</p>

<p>“But he does,” said Lily. “I saw a weeny little tear
on his cheek this morning, for to-day is Uncle Tom’s
burfday, and his voice goes all shaky like, ’cause he was
so fond of poor Uncle Tom, and says he was so good.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman sat silent, staring hard at the ground.</p>

<p>“Is it long since Uncle Tom went away?” he said
at last.</p>

<p>“It is ten years,” replied Hugh. “It was the year I
was born.”</p>

<p>“Ten years—so it is,” murmured the old gentleman—“only
ten years, and it has seemed like a hundred.”</p>

<p>The children looked at one another surprised.</p>

<p>“Did you ever know Uncle Tom?” asked Hugh
curiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew him well. I was on his ship.”</p>

<p>“But you aren’t drowned!” cried Lily.</p>

<p>The old gentleman smiled.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “I wasn’t drowned; I got off safe.
Uncle Tom used to talk to me, though, about his old home,
and one day he said that he had carved his name on a tree
in the park, and I was to go and see it if I ever got home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll show you,” said little Tom. “It is on a
beech tree close by here. I’ll show you. There it is.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a tree on which some initials and a date
were cut deep into the bark.</p>

<p>“It has kept very fresh,” said the old gentleman. “I
thought it would have been grown over by now.”</p>

<p>“Father always comes and tidies it up on uncle’s birthday,”
said the boy. “See, he is coming now! I’ll go and
tell him you are here.—Father!” he shouted, running off—“father,
here’s a gentleman who knew Uncle Tom!”</p>

<p>But when father came near and saw the old gentleman,
he stared at him for a moment as if he had seen a ghost,
and then he gave a great cry.</p>

<p>“Tom, Tom, it is you yourself!”</p>

<p>And it <i>was</i> Uncle Tom, who had not been drowned
after all, but when the ship was wrecked had managed to
get ashore to an island, and there had lived on the fish he
caught, and birds’ eggs, and cocoa-nuts, watching for a sail,
like Robinson Crusoe. At last the sail came after ten long
years. And when he reached England he did not write,
but came down to his old home to see who was there, for
of course he had heard no tidings all the time.</p>

<p>Nobody recognized him at the village, for the tropical
sun had burned his skin brown, and the long waiting and
the sorrow and the hardships had turned his hair white.
Only his brother knew him by his eyes, for they two had
loved each other very much.</p>

<p>“But what will father do with your tombstone?” said
Lily gravely, as she sat on her uncle’s knee that night.
“It is such a pretty one, with a beautiful angel on it!”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“ISN’T it fun, Dolly?” asked Eric, as he and
his little sister ran along the sea front as fast
as their sturdy legs could carry them.</p>

<p>Eric was the jolliest little boy imaginable,
but, unfortunately, a little bit too fond of mischief,
and Dolly was generally only too eager
to join in her brother’s pranks.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

</div>
<p>Just now they were running away from nurse, who was
down on the sands with baby. They waited until her head
was turned away, then off they ran.</p>

<p>“We’ll go out to the rocks
and play at being shipwrecked
sailors,” Eric went on. “I’ve
got some biscuits in my pocket,
and I’ll dole them out, piece by
piece, and pretend we shan’t have any more food unless a
boat takes us off.”</p>


<p>Poor Eric! his play very soon became earnest, for he
and Dolly waded out to a big rock in a very lonely part
of the coast, and so interested were they in their game
that they never noticed the tide coming in until it had
surrounded them, and there was no getting back.</p>

<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="458" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ALONG THE SEA FRONT.</div>
</div>

<p>They waited on and on, hoping some one would come
for them, and fearing every moment that the sea would
cover the rock, and that they would be drowned.</p>

<p>It was long past dinner-time, and they were wet through
and hungry and wretched when at last a fisherman, who
had been sent out to search for them, spied the two forlorn
little figures, and rescued them.</p>

<p>They went home hand in hand, very solemn and silent,
expecting to get a good scolding; but instead of that, mother
burst into tears of relief, and both Eric and Dolly felt so
thoroughly ashamed of themselves for having frightened
their darling mother so terribly that it was a very long, long
time before they got into mischief again.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE sunniest of days, the
clearest and loveliest of
blue seas, and I, a little lobster,
young, proud, and as lively as a
cricket—that is what people say;
but I can’t help thinking “as lively as a shrimp” would
sound better.</p>

<p>I always wear a lovely suit of armour, like those old
warriors you read about. It is strong and firm and well
jointed, so that I can move ever so fast—of course not so
fast as that silly little fish.</p>

<p>He has armour too, he says, but wears it <i>inside</i>. That
seems queer to me; I can’t quite believe it.</p>

<p>But I want to tell you what a queer thing happened
to mine not long ago. <i>It grew small and shabby</i>, like your
last year’s dress; that is why I have called this story “Old
Clothes.”</p>

<p>Listen. I lived a very happy life out at sea for some
time, till one day I fell into a strange basket-box thing.</p>

<p>There were several other lobsters and one or two
crabs sitting there, looking anxious and disturbed. And
I soon found out that they had need to feel so, for there
was no <i>exit</i>. That means “way out” in plain words.</p>

<p>Our basket was joined to a strong rope, and that was
attached to a cork floating on the top of the water.</p>

<p>Not long after I had fallen into this basket, which I
now know was a lobster-trap, a boat rowed out from the
shore, stopped just above us, and then we were lifted up,
up, right out of the water, and placed in the boat.</p>

<p>The next thing was a good deal of pushing and knocking
about, and then some one tossed me carelessly out on
the beach, saying roughly, “Too small for any use.”</p>

<p>But some one else thought differently. Another hand
touched me, and another voice said, “Just the thing for
my aquarium.”</p>

</div>

<p>What that meant I could not even guess; but it turned
out to be the tiniest sea in the world. Steady old limpets,
red anemones, hermit crabs, and shrimps were all there.</p>

<p>It was a very nice home, with plenty of good food, the
only drawback being want of space.</p>

<p>And now the event happened that I promised to tell
you about.</p>

<p>My armour took to hurting me. You will hardly believe
me. We all know that <i>new</i> clothes hurt sometimes,
but <i>old</i> ones!</p>

<p>It grew tighter and tighter. I wriggled about, feeling
miserable. Oh, if only I could get out of this!</p>

<p>At last I grew desperate. This choked, tight feeling
was too much. I gave a tremendous struggle, and shook
myself; crickle, crackle went my old armour, off it came,
and out I stepped.</p>

<p>But, oh, so tender, and so nervous! The shrimps
pranced round and knocked up against me, pricking and
tormenting till I could have screamed.</p>

<p>I crept behind a stone and looked at my old armour
half sadly. It looked just like old me, only so still, and
rather as if I had been out in the rain all night and had
shrunk.</p>

<p>Then I glanced at the new me. Well, I was a pretty
fellow—not blue-black any longer, but a reddish pink of
lovely hue.</p>

<p>Some one else took pride in my appearance, for I
heard again a voice say, “Look at my lobster; he has cast
his shell.”</p>

<p>I hadn’t, you know—it was the shell that had cast me;
but these men can’t know <i>everything</i>.</p>

<p>The man touched me, but he hurt me almost as much
as the shrimps, and I shrank farther still behind the stone
out of his way. There I quietly lay for some days, till
one morning, feeling braver and ever so much bigger, I
stepped out for an early saunter.</p>

<p>That moment came a voice, “Oh, here is my lobster!
How he has grown, more than half as big again!” Down
came the hand as before; and just to show him I was also
half as <i>strong</i> again, I gave him a nip.</p>

<p>He keeps his hands above water now, and <i>me</i> at arm’s
length.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">OUT in the garden Mary sat hemming
a pocket-handkerchief, and there
came a little insect running—oh, in
such a hurry!—across the small stone
table by her side.</p>

<p>The sewing was not done, for
Mary liked doing nothing best, and
she thought it would be fun to drop
her thimble over the little ant.
“Now he is in the dark,” said she.
“Can he mind? He is only such a
little tiny thing.”</p>

<p>Mary ran away, for her mother called her, and she
forgot all about the ant under the thimble.</p>

<p>There he was, running round and round and round the
dark prison, with little horns on his head quivering, little
perfect legs bending as beautifully as those of a race-horse,
and he was in quite as big a fright as if he were an elephant.</p>

<p>“Oh,” you would have heard him say, if you had been
clever enough, “I can’t get out, I can’t get out! I shall lie
down and die.”
”
Mary went to bed, and in the night the rain poured.
The handkerchief was soaked as if somebody had been
crying very much, when she went out to fetch it as soon
as the sun shone. She remembered who was under the
thimble. “I wonder what he is doing,” said Mary. But
when she lifted up the thimble the little tiny thing lay stiff
and still.</p>

<p>“Oh, did he die of being under the thimble?” she said
aloud. “I am afraid he <i>did</i> mind.”</p>

<p>“Why did you do that, Mary?” said her father, who was
close by, and who had guessed the truth. “See! he moves
one of his legs. Run to the house and fetch a wee taste of
honey from the breakfast-table for the little thing you
starved.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to,” said Mary.</p>

<p>She touched the honey in the spoon with a blade of
grass, and tenderly put a drop of it before the little ant.
He put out a fairy tongue to lick up the sweet stuff. He
grew well, and stood upon his pretty little jointed feet. He
tried to run.</p>

<p>“Where is he in such a hurry to go, do you think?”
said father.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Mary softly. She felt ashamed.</p>

<p>“He wants to run home,” said father. “I know where
he lives. In a little round world of ants, under the apple
tree.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Has such a little tiny thing a real home of his
own? I should have thought he lived just anywhere about.”</p>

<p>“Why, he would not like that at all. At home he has
a fine palace, with passages and rooms more than you could
count; he and the others dug them out, that they might
all live together like little people in a little town.”</p>

<p>“And has he got a wife and children—a lot of little ants
at home?”</p>

<p>“The baby ants are born as eggs; they are little helpless
things, and must be carried about by their big relations.
There are father ants and mother ants, and lots of other
ants who are nurses to the little ones. Nobody knows his
own children, but all the grown-up ones are kind to all the
babies. This is a little nurse ant. See how she hurries
off! Her babies at home must have their faces washed.”</p>

<p>“O father!” cried Mary; “now that is a fairy story.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said father. “Ants really <i>do</i> clean
their young ones by licking them. On sunny days they
carry their babies out, and let them lie in the sun. On cold
days they take them downstairs, away from the cold wind
and the rain. The worker ants are the nurses. Though
the little ones are not theirs, they love them and care for
them as dearly as if they were.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i025.jpg" width="600" height="215" alt="bugs" />
</div>

<p>“Why, that’s just like Aunt Jenny who lives with us,
and mends our things, and puts baby to bed, and goes
out for walks with us.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” said father, laughing.</p>

<p>“Is that the reason we say <i>Ant</i> Jenny?”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 451px;">
<img src="images/i026.jpg" width="451" height="600" alt="different bugs" />
</div>

<p>“You little dunce! Who taught you to spell? But it
is not a bad idea, all the same. It would be a good
thing if there were as many ‘ant’ Jennys in this big
round world of ours as there
are in the ants’ little round
world—folk who care for all,
no matter whose children
they are.”</p>

<p>While they were talking,
the little ant crept to the
edge of the table, and down
the side, and was soon lost
among the blades of grass.</p>

<p>“He will never find his
way,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Let him alone for that,”
said father. “The ants have
paths leading from their hill.
They never lose their way.
But they meet with sad accidents sometimes. What do you
think I saw the other day? One of these small chaps—it
may have been this very one—was carrying home a scrap
of something in his jaws for the youngsters at home. As
he ran along, a bird dropped an ivy berry on him. Poor
mite of a thing! This was worse than if a cannon ball were
to fall from the sky on one of us. He lay under it, not
able to move. By-and-by one of his brother ants, who was
taking a stroll, caught sight of him under the berry.</p>

<p>“What did he do?” said Mary.</p>

<p>“First he tried to push the berry off his friend’s body,
but it was too heavy. Next he caught hold of one of his
friend’s legs with his jaws, and tugged till I thought it would
come off. Then he rushed about in a frantic state, as if he
were saying to himself, ‘What shall I do? what shall I do?’
And then he ran off up the path. In another minute he
came hurrying back with three other ants.”</p>

<p>“Is it quite true, father?”</p>

<p>“Quite. The four ants talked together by gentle touches
of their horns. They looked as if they were telling one
another what a dreadful accident it was, and how nobody
knew whose turn would come next. After this they set to
work with a will. Two of them pushed the berry as hard
as they could, while the other two pulled their friend out
by the hind legs. When at last he was free, they crowded
round as if petting and kissing him. You see these little
ant folk have found out that ‘’Tis love, love, love, that
makes the world go round.’ I shouldn’t wonder if that ant
you teased so thoughtlessly is gone off to tell the news at
home that there is a drop of honey to be had here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he couldn’t, father!”</p>

<p>“Wait and see,” said father.</p>

<p>In a little while back came the ant with a troop of friends.</p>

<p>“He has been home and told them the good news
about the honey,” said father. “Do you think that all children
are as kind as that?”</p>

<p>Mary said, “No, they’re not. I don’t run to call all
the others when I find a good place for blackberries.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said father, “don’t be unkind to the ant, who
is kinder than you, though he is only a little tiny thing.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“DON’T do it, Dick!”
pleaded Dolly.</p>

<p>“Girls always spoil
sport!” growled Mark, as
he saw Dick ready to
give in.</p>

<p>“We shan’t hurt the
boat! Don’t be silly, Dolly.
Even if the sails do get
wet, Tom can get fresh
ones. And it will be
better for him to know
whether it will sail or not.”
And the twins departed
for the seashore with the
boat in their hands.</p>

<p>How they wished they had taken Dolly’s advice, when
they saw the ship, which had sailed so gallantly at first in
the little cove, break from its moorings and drift out to sea!</p>

<p>Tom had worked very hard for the prize of £2 offered
in a weekly paper for the best-made boat, not only for the
sake of the money, but because the toys were to go to the
Home for Orphans. And now all his work was gone.</p>

<p>“Oh! well, it can’t be helped,” he said good-naturedly,
when his first feeling of anger had passed; “but I wish
you chaps would leave my things alone.”</p>

<p>“But it can be helped,” said Dolly, rushing in. “See!
a fisherman brought it to shore, and it isn’t a bit broken.”</p>

<p>So the orphans got the boat after all, and had great
fun sailing it in the river near the Home; and what was
perhaps more wonderful, Tom won the prize.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Little_Thief_in_the_Pantry" id="The_Little_Thief_in_the_Pantry">The Little Thief in the Pantry.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“MOTHER dear,” said a little mouse one day, “I
think the people in our house must be very kind;
don’t you? They leave such nice things for us in the larder.”</p>

<p>There was a twinkle in the mother’s eye as she replied,—</p>

<p>“Well, my child, no doubt they are very well in their
way, but I don’t think they are quite as fond of us as you
seem to think. Now remember, Greywhiskers, I have
absolutely forbidden you to put your nose above the ground
unless I am with you, for kind as the people are, I shouldn’t
be at all surprised if they tried to catch you.”</p>

<p>Greywhiskers twitched his tail with scorn; he was quite
sure he knew how to take care of himself, and he didn’t
mean to trot meekly after his mother’s tail all his life. So
as soon as she had curled herself up for an afternoon nap
he stole away, and scampered across the pantry shelves.</p>

<p>Ah! here was something particularly good to-day. A
large iced cake stood far back upon the shelf, and Greywhiskers
licked his lips as he sniffed it. Across the top
of the cake there were words written in pink sugar; but
as Greywhiskers could not read, he did not know that he
was nibbling at little Miss Ethel’s birthday cake. But he
did feel a little guilty when he heard his mother calling.
Off he ran, and was back in the nest again by the time his
mother had finished rubbing her eyes after her nap.</p>

<p>She took Greywhiskers up to the pantry then, and when
she saw the hole in the cake she seemed a little annoyed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 492px;">
<img src="images/i036.jpg" width="492" height="580" alt="boy looking at mouse in cage while girl holds cat" />
</div>

<p>“Some mouse has evidently been here before us,” she
said, but of course she never guessed that it was her own
little son.</p>

<p>The next day the naughty little mouse again popped
up to the pantry when his mother was asleep; but at first
he could find nothing at all to eat, though there was a
most delicious smell of toasted cheese.</p>

<p>Presently he found a dear little wooden house, and
there hung the cheese, just inside it.</p>

<p>In ran Greywhiskers, but, oh! “click” went the little
wooden house, and mousie was caught fast in a trap.</p>

<p>When the morning came, the cook, who had set the
trap, lifted it from the shelf, and then called a pretty little
girl to come and see the thief who had eaten her cake.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with him?” asked Ethel.</p>

<p>“Why, drown him, my dear, to be sure.”</p>

<p>The tears came into the little girl’s pretty blue eyes.</p>

<p>“You didn’t know it was stealing, did you, mousie
dear?” she said.</p>

<p>“No,” squeaked Greywhiskers sadly; “indeed I didn’t.”</p>

<p>Cook’s back was turned for a moment, and in that
moment tender-hearted little Ethel lifted the lid of the trap,
and out popped mousie.</p>

<p>Oh! how quickly he ran home to his mother, and how
she comforted and petted him until he began to forget his
fright; and then she made him promise never to disobey
her again, and you may be sure he never did.</p>

<p>“Oh, do tell me!” cried Trots.</p>

<p>“Well, once upon a time, as she was carrying her butter
to market, she picked up a crooked sixpence. And with
it, and what she sold her butter for, she bought a little
black pig. Now, coming home, she had to cross the brook;
so she picked piggy up in her arms and carried her over the
brook. And, lo, instead of a pig, there was a little fairy in
her arms!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Trots, “what was it like?”</p>

<p>“Well, it had a red cap on its head, and a green frock,
and it had gauzy wings, and it wanted to fly away, but
great-grandmother held it tight.</p>

<p>“‘Please let me go,’ said the fairy.</p>

<p>“‘What will you give me?’ said great-grandmother.</p>

<p>“‘I will give you one wish,’” answered the fairy.</p>

<p>So great-grandmother thought and thought what was
the best thing to wish for, and at last she said,—</p>

<p>“‘Give to me and to my daughters to the eleventh
generation the lucky finger and the loving heart.’</p>

<p>“‘You have wished a big wish,’ said the fairy, ‘but
you shall have it.’” So she kissed great-grandmother’s eyes
and mouth, and then she flew away.</p>

<p>“And did the wish come true?” asked Trots.</p>

<p>“Always—always,” answered grannie. “We have been
since then the best spinners and knitters in all the countryside,
and the best wives and daughters.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Trots, “what will the eleventh generation
do when the wish stops and the good-luck?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said grannie, shaking her head. “I
suppose they’ll have to catch a fairy of their own.”</p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
